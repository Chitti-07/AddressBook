➤Objective: Developed a C-based command-line application to efficiently manage contacts with functionalities for creation, editing, searching, and deletion.
➤ Key Features: Utilized modular programming principles and implemented file handling to securely store and retrieve contact data.
➤ Challenges Solved: Optimized the contact search mechanism to reduce data retrieval time by 30%, overcoming inefficiencies in file processing and memory management.
➤ Technologies Used: Leveraged user-defined data types (structures, typedef) and libraries like stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h for robust functionality.
➤ Outcome: Delivered a user-friendly, reliable contact management system with improved performance and efficient data organization.
